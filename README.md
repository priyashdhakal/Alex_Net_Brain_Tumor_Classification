# Alex_Net_Brain_Tumor_Classification
AlexNet was not specifically designed for tumor classification, its architecture can be adapted and applied to medical imaging tasks, including tumor
classification. The fundamental idea behind using AlexNet or similar CNN architectures for tumor classification is that CNNs are well-suited for learning
hierarchical features from images, making them effective for pattern recognition tasks.

##  Dataset
A private collection of T1, contrast-enhanced T1, and T2 magnetic resonance images separated by brain tumor type.
Images without any type of marking or patient identification, interpreted by radiologists and provided for study purposes.
The images are separated by astrocytoma, carcinoma, ependymoma, ganglioglioma, germinoma, glioblastoma, granuloma, medulloblastoma, meningioma, neurocytoma, oligodendroglioma, papilloma, schwannoma and tuberculoma.
